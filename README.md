# Word-Guess-Game

#HANGMAN GAME
This is the bootcamp homework 3.
 By now, just have some basic functions. 
  * Randomly choose one word from word poll.  
  * Dynamic test number basing on word length. 
  * Ability to adjust the difficulty of the game by changing the rate assigned on the test number.
        ```
        Math.floor(word.length * rate);
        ```
